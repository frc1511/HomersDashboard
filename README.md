# Homer's Dashboard
Homer’s Dashboard is a custom dashboard used to interface with 1511’s robots. It was created during the 2022 off-season and was originally designed only for Homer, but it has since been expanded for all competition robots. The dashboard is updated every year to fit the specific needs of each year’s robot.
